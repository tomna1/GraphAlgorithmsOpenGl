TODO:

- Currently the grid is centred around 0,0 so the user can move the camera out of grid. FIX.
- Refactor Renderer and Mesh Classes to allow different vertex attributes to be added.
- Change MappedGraph and GraphNode classes to use the insertion operator instead of a print function.
- Make model scale attribute usable.
- Be able to select 2 nodes at a time.
