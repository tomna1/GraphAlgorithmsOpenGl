TODO:

- Add a proper coordinate system which marks the coordinates the mouse is currently on.
- Currently the grid is centred around 0,0 so the user can move the camera out of grid. FIX.
- Refactor Renderer and Mesh Classes to allow different vertex attributes to be added.
- Add the ability to add nodes to a graph while program is running.
